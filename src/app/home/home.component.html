      I built this website using the Angular framework but I also know React.
      <br>
       My most current project that I am working on is creating a web analytics dashboard in React for the start up <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/food-origins/about/">Food Origins</a>.

    <!-- <h2>Why I started coding.</h2>
    <p>It was my sophomore year in highschool when I stumbled on a project for a RaspberryPi camera, <br>
       I though it was so cool, having no previous coding experiance I decided to take up the challange.
       Unfortunately this project ended in failure but since then I knew coding is what I wanted to do.</p> -->
